percolation
===========

Calculation of percolation thresholds for 2d lattices for Tez. Makes use of the boost::graph library.

The percolated honeycomb lattices considered here correspond to certain quantum 'cluster' states prepared using optical bell pairs and fusion gates. 

For background on such thresholds see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_threshold">here</a> and see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605014">quant-ph/0605014</a> for their significance in quantum computing.
