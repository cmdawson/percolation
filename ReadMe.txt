-Compile by running make

This code scans fusion probabilities for a pyrochlore lattice of size 2x2x2 to 16x16x16 to show that 75% fusion probability is above the percolation threshold given the lattice generation scheme 
presented in the accompanying paper. Probabilities will be scanned from 0.69 to 0.71 in increments of 0.001, and each lattice size will be sampled 1000 times. Also, input Q=1 to match the 
scheme of the paper.

This version produces an output text file (e.g. simulationThresholdSizes1000TrialsFineScale for Fig. 6b of the paper ) with columns:
N 	NY	NZ	latticeSize	p	sampleSize	crossings	connectedClusterSize

where latticeSize is the total number of qubits in the underlying lattice (some/most of which will not be in the connected cluster),
sampleSize is the number of times each fusion probability is sampled, and
connectedClusterSize is the average number of qubits in a connected cluster. The cluster size is the averaged size over the number of successful crossings.

Figure 6 of the paper was made by plotting the data generated by this code using Mathematica (the resolution of probability steps was 0.1 for Fig. 6a and 0.001 for Fig 6b)

With minor modifications to test.cpp (no modifications to any other files needed) and uncommenting some code in test.cpp, test.cpp can be made to take the input parameters:

N = size of lattice in x direction
NY = size of lattice in y direction
NZ = size of lattice in z direction
Samples = number of trials
p = success probability of Bell measurement, the code scans from p-0.15 to p+0.15 to find the percolation threshold probability
q = probability of an edge being there, which we have always set to 1 since our protocol only requires us to delete vertices

With the above modifications one can produce Table 1 of the paper.
